## Invalid opcodes

The invalid opcodes are: `0x0c - 0x0f`, `0x1e-0x1f`, `0x49-0x4f`, `0x5c-0x5f`, `0xa5-0xef`, `0xf6-0xf9`, `0xfb-0xfc` and `0xfe`.

On execution of any invalid operation, whether the designated INVALID opcode or simply an undefined opcode, all remaining gas is consumed and the state is reverted to the point immediately prior to the beginning of the current execution context.
